# The GAP package PositionClass

This package provides functions that allow to quickly identify the equivalence
classes of elements.  The main idea is to use class invariants and arrange them
in a tree.

The main use is the identification of conjugacy classes in groups, for which
several invariants are provided.

The package also provides functions for the computation of power maps (of single
conjugacy classes).
